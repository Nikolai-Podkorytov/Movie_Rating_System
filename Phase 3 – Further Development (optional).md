# Phase 3 Objective

## Objective
You can further develop your project based on a chosen use case, functionality, or other improvement area.

### Where to get ideas for further development?
- Based on the use cases defined in phase 1.
- Review features implemented in phase 2:
  - What was missing?
  - What works but needs finishing?
  - Where could the user experience or performance be better?
- You can develop a single use case further, add a new feature, or improve an existing implementation.

### Examples of further development
- Additional UI component or view
- Usability improvements
- Responsive design
- Optimization of storage, authentication, or data handling
- More advanced single use case (e.g., canceling or modifying a reservation)

## Summary of Completed and Missing Elements

### ‚úÖ What was completed (based on Phases 1 and 2):

#### Phase 1:
- Defined user roles and scenarios (enthusiast, viewer, critic, admin, guest).
- Outlined user flows: registration, movie browsing, reviews, search.
- Created interface prototypes.
- Planned architecture (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React).
- Planned testing and scalability.

#### Phase 2:
- Implemented authentication and roles.
- Created main pages: login, registration, movie list, add movie.
- Implemented CRUD operations for movies.
- Set up MongoDB database.
- Added filtering, validation, error handling.
- Made the interface responsive and adaptive.

---

### ‚ùå What was missed or not completed:

#### From Phase 1:
- No mention of cloud deployment.
- No CI/CD or automation.
- No analytics or logging.
- No strategy for image storage (e.g., posters).

#### From Phase 2:
- The site was deployed in the cloud but worked partially ‚Äî development continued locally.
- Admin panel not implemented.
- No average rating calculation on the movie details page.
- No ability to edit movies (admin only).
- No advanced security measures (XSS, CSRF, etc.).

---

## üöÄ Directions for Further Development

### üîß Key tasks:
- Calculate and display average rating on the movie details page.
- Implement movie editing functionality (admin only).
- Enhance security measures (XSS, CSRF protection).
- Improve user interface and experience (confirmation dialogs, navigation).

### üí° Ideas for new features:
- Mobile application or PWA.
- Recommendation system based on user interests.
- Favorites / Watchlist.
- Viewing history.
- A/B testing of the interface.
- Admin analytics (popular movies, user activity).

---

### Note:
The site was initially deployed in the cloud but due to incomplete implementation, development continued locally to finalize all features.
### Note: 
Also during Phase 2 was a lot of trouble in render so project continie in local machine till Phase 4. and will be created different Git for final ver.
