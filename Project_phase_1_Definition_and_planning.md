- The user selects a movie from the catalog and accesses its detailed page.  

**Result:**  
- The user receives complete information about the movie, such as its description, rating, reviews, and trailer.  

---

### 3. Leave a Review and Rating  
**User:** Film Enthusiast Alex, Casual Viewer Emma, or Critic Daniel.  **who have account** 

**Trigger:** The user opens the movie's page and clicks on "Leave a Review."  

**Process:**  
- The user writes a review and rates the movie (on a scale of 1 to 10).  
- After clicking "Publish," the review is displayed in the reviews section under the movie.  

**Result:**  
- The review and rating are stored and become accessible to other users.

### Prototype Objectives  
Before designing the prototype, I identified specific goals to achieve during its development:  
- **Define key functionalities and interactions**  
- **Sketch a rough layout of the website**  
- **Plan the necessary features**  

### Prototype Development  
The prototype began with hand-drawn sketches to conceptualize the layout.  

#### Prototype Elements:  
1. **Homepage**  
2. **Movie Details Page**  
3. **User Profile**  
4. **Search and Filter Options**  
5. **Admin Panel (for Admin users)**  
6. **Ratings and Reviews**  

### Future Updates  
During the prototyping phase, I identified the need for updates:  
1. **Navigation Improvements**  
2. **Editing Movie Details**

## 4. Information Architecture and Technical Design

### Outline the Structure  
To ensure the platform is scalable and organized, I propose using a relational database to manage data, including movie details, user profiles, reviews, and ratings. Metadata structures will be implemented to allow advanced filtering options, such as genres.

### Back-End Infrastructure  
I plan to use **Node.js** for server-side logic due to its efficiency and scalability, combined with **Express.js** for building APIs. For data storage, **MongoDB** is an excellent option to handle complex relationships and user-generated content seamlessly.

### Front-End Frameworks  
For the front-end, I am leveraging **React** to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Its component-based structure ensures modularity and simplifies maintenance.

### Scalability Plan  
To handle increasing traffic as the platform grows, I plan to utilize cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS or Azure) paired with load balancers. This setup will ensure the platform remains reliable during peak activity.

### Security Measures (Future Updates)  
Security is critical for maintaining user trust. Key measures include:  
- **SSL Encryption:** Protect data during transmission  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Enhance account security by adding an extra layer of verification  
- Regular audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities

## 5. Project Management and User Testing

### Testing Strategy  
To ensure the platform meets user expectations and technical standards, I will conduct the following types of testing:

1. **Usability Testing:**  
   - Assess ease of navigation and user interaction with key features.  
   - Identify pain points and areas for improvement in the user journey.

2. **Functional Testing:**  
   - Verify that features such as search, registration, ratings, and reviews work as intended.  
   - Ensure seamless integration between front-end and back-end components.

3. **Load Testing:**  
   - Evaluate platform performance under varying levels of user traffic.  
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks to maintain smooth operation during peak usage.

4. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**  
   - Validate the entire workflow from the user's perspective, simulating real-world interactions.  
   - Ensure that all integrated components—from front-end to back-end—work cohesively.

### Feedback Loop  
I will collect user feedback during the testing phase and iteratively update the platform based on real user experiences.
